# Daily Recipe App

## About The Project

The Daily Recipe App is an ASP.NET Core web-based application that allows users to load a random vegetarian recipe with the click of a button. This project showcases the ability to integrate external APIs into a web application and dynamically update the content on the page using AJAX.

### Key Features:

- **Random Recipe Generation**: Users can generate a new recipe, including title and image, each time they interact with the application.
- **AJAX Integration**: The application leverages asynchronous JavaScript to update the web page content without needing to reload the page.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the Spoonacular API to fetch random recipe information.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Implements Bootstrap for responsive design and stylish UI components.
- **User-friendly Layout**: Designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

### Skills and Technologies Used:

- ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
- JavaScript and AJAX for asynchronous web requests
- Integration with external APIs (Spoonacular)
- HTML & CSS with Bootstrap framework for responsive design
- C# for backend logic

## Project Screenshots

Here are a couple of screenshots showcasing the application's functionality:

## Learning Outcomes

Through the development of the Daily Recipe App, I have gained practical experience in the following areas:

- Implementing and understanding the flow of data between client-side JavaScript and server-side C# in an ASP.NET Core application.
- Utilizing third-party APIs to enhance application functionality.
- Applying asynchronous programming concepts to improve the responsiveness of web applications.
- Crafting a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.
